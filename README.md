# Course-server-Login-Tracker

This project is a "Course Server login tracker" which was created as part of the "Advanced Java Programming" course in my University studies.

What it does:<br>
The server generates messages to all of the users which are currently connected, specifying logins and disconnects of the different users in real time.

*Usernames should be stored in the usernames.txt file inside the project directory (each line specifies a different username) .
